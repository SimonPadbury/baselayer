[Updating: numbers in index.css, README.md, data/metadata.json, package.json, and package-lock.json (twice).]

## 1 Dec 2022 -- v.1.1.0

* Added `[class*=grid] { display:grid }` to ensure that `grid gap` works at all viewport widths.
* Added `expand-right` and `expand-left` to the content grid for e.g. asymmetrical blockquotes.
* Improveddimensions, including width variables now in 7 Ã— 256px increments, 
    * `xxs` 256px
    * `xs` 512px
    * `sm` 768px
    * `md` 1024px
    * `lg` 1280px
    * `xl` 1440px
    * `xxl` 1600 px (same as max-width of `container`)
* Another tier of invisibility classes: `lg`.

## 30 Nov 2022 -- v.1.0.6

* Added `--b4` tier for borders
* Refactored border radius to `--r2` through `--r4` to pair with borders `--b2` through `--b4`. And now both are set in pixels. (There is no `--r1` because no need for a 1px border radius.)
* Removed the forced left-alignment of the first column of cells in `<table>`.

* Added hover states of _colors_, so hover can change a color (not only change a shade).

* Further improvements to forms and buttons.
* Added `hmax100vh`.
* Added `inlineflex`.
