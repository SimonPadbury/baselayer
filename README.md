# Baselayer

v.1.0.2

Baselayer is a splendiferous yet miniscule CSS library.

Designed as a good place to start, Baselayer may be all you need â€” for small static websites and blogs. Or you may use it as a _baselayer_ to quick-start your mega project.

Ready to use as-is, Baselayer gives you all this and more:

* A modern CSS reset
* Basic accessibility features
* Responsive typography
* Simple responsive layouts using positioning, dimensions, flexbox, and grid
* A lightweight system of utility classes for controlling spacing, borders, and colors
* Styled form elements and buttons
* Control of many of these things using CSS variables (custom properties)

Believe it or not, all this is packed into a tiny CSS file, **14kb**.

Baselayer uses some modern web technologies such as CSS Grid and CSS variables, so it supports only modern web browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.). Sorry, it does not support Internet Explorer.
